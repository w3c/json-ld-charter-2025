        <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
        <p>
          JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data) is a widely used method of encoding Linked Data using JSON.
          Use of JSON-LD has grown and expanded over the last decade (since it's first publication as a
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-api1/">W3C Recommendation in 2014</a>).
          JSON-LD remains a popular choice for encoding <abbr title="Seach Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr>-focused
          structured data in Web pages using <a href="https://schema.org">schema.org</a>. JSON-LD has also become a foundational format for social media
          (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/">ActivityStreams</a>),
          Internet of Things data (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description11/">Web of Things Description</a>),
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/">Verifiable Credentials</a>, or Software Bill of Materials
          (<a href="https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0.1/serializations/#serialization-in-json-ld">SPDX</a>).
        </p>

        <p>This growth in the applied use of JSON-LD has led to a community interest in additional expressions of
          JSON-LD's underlying Linked Data structure in other formats. YAML-LD has been created by the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/json-ld/">JSON for Linking Data Community Group</a> to ease human
          authoring and to provide a clearer path for using Linked Data applied to popular YAML-based documents such as
          infrastructure as code, static site front matter, and API documentation formats.
        </p>

        <p>
          For a number of application areas, the size of JSON-LD content is an obstacle. Size constraints may be
          encountered when storing data as a QR or in a barcode, transmitting data over low bandwidth channels, or when relying
          on high volume data storage. These constraints are not only significant for existing applications, but are also
          obstacles to enable new application areas (e.g., in embedded systems). CBOR-LD, based on 
          <a href="https://cbor.io/spec.html">CBOR</a> (which already has a large user and tool base), can exploit 
          the linked data features of JSON-LD, and provide a high level and easily reversible compression of
          JSON-LD data. Work on CBOR-LD has begun in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/json-ld/">JSON 
          for Linking Data Community Group</a>, and will be finalized by the JSON-LD Working Group.
        </p>

        <p>
          The goal of this new, more inclusively focused JSON-LD WG is to meet the demand of the broader
          JSON-LD community by strengthening the foundational JSON-LD specifications, growing the family 
          of JSON-LD related formats which orbit around the JSON-LD processing model, and specifying improved
          context retrieval methods for greater clarity and stability.
        </p>

      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
				<p>
					The Working Group will evolve the recommendations defining JSON-LD 
          (i.e., <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/">JSON-LD 1.1</a>, 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11-api/">JSON-LD 1.1 API</a>, and
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11-framing/">JSON-LD 1.1 Framing</a>) by handling Errata 
          and by adding requested features, as recorded on columns 4 ("Errata") and 5 ("Future Work")
          of the group's <a href="https://github.com/orgs/w3c/projects/84">Project Management Page</a>. 
          To handle these, 
          the Working Group will issue new versions of these recommendations, possibly with new features,
          in order to make future usage and evolutions easier. In particular, the Working Group will handle 
          two important security related problems:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            JSON-LD has become a common structural foundation for a wide range of data models. Some of 
            those environments have more restrictive requirements than others on how unmapped terms should be treated (i.e., 
            when JSON keys present in the document have no term definition in the context). The current 
            JSON-LD API stipulates that the unknown term is silently ignored. The Working Group will specify 
            a "safe mode", that will detect these situations and cause the processing to fail instead. This mode is 
            already available in some JSON-LD API implementations, such as 
            <a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/jsonld.js?tab=readme-ov-file#safe-mode">jsonld.js</a> and 
            <a href="https://dotnetrdf.org/2025-07-03-dn4-3-4-0-released/#:~:text=This%20release%20also%20introduces%20a,rather%20than%20silently%20ignoring%20them.">dotNetRDF</a>, 
            and is especially useful if the resulting RDF Graph is to be canonicalized.
          </li>
          <li>
            External (i.e., non-inline) JSON-LD context files are identified using URIs. This is a common
            pattern across many technologies that has, at times, confused implementers who 
            expect that they should always use these identifiers as locators, and dereference them. This
            assumption can create risks and vulnerabilities that have been documented, but also often overlooked, in previous versions of JSON-LD.
            The Working Group intends to address this problem through more explanatory
            specification text, but also through the exploration of options such as the addition of a hash
            fragment to be used with the application/ld+json media type responses. This fragment conveys a 
            content hash which may be used by implementations to further confirm and handle the intentions 
            of the original document author. (This has already been discussed by the Working Group, see, 
            for example, the open issues <a href="https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/108">108</a>,
             <a href="https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/436">436</a> or 
            <a href="https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/422">422</a>.)
          </li>
        </ol>

        <!-- Note that the JSON-LD APIs are not browser specific; while appropriate for use within browsers, they are not limited to such use, and there is no requirement for browsers to implement them natively. -->


        <p>
          Development of the 1.2 versions of the JSON-LD specifications will follow the principle of 
          backward compatibility. This means that any valid JSON-LD 1.1 document will remain valid
          for JSON-LD 1.2, and that the algorithms defined by the JSON-LD 1.2 API specification will yield 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#graph-isomorphism">isomorphic</a> results to
          those of the JSON-LD 1.1 API — barring any bug or inconsistency of the JSON-LD 1.1 
          specifications identified in the errata.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Working Group will also develop new Recommendation Track deliverables, based on work incubated by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/json-ld/">JSON for Linking Data Community Group</a>,
          specifying the use of JSON-LD algorithms with similar formats, namely YAML and CBOR. 
          These formats will provide reversible serializations/compressions to JSON-LD 1.2.
          Other formats may be incubated in conjunction with the Community Group, but will not be part of 
          Recommendation track deliverables.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Working Group is expected to coordinate with the <a href='https://www.w3.org/community/json-ld/'>JSON for Linking Data Community Group</a> on consensus-based proposals related to content changes for the JSON-LD Working Group Deliverables. The Chairs of this group may choose to reject proposals that are incompatible with this Charter.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Working Group will also produce some informational text clarifying further when application
          developers are advised to use JSON-LD's data modeling and term mapping, as opposed to "plain" JSON documents. It has not yet
          been decided whether this will become part of one the current Recommendations, or will be the subject of a 
          separate Working Group Note.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, the Working Group will start working on the introduction of the new 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf12-concepts">RDF 1.2</a>
          concepts (primarily triple terms and directional language-tagged string), into the JSON-LD syntax, API, and Framing. The final goal is to 
          have, eventually, a version of JSON-LD that is fully compatible with the upcoming RDF 1.2
          version, and provides shortcuts similar to those in
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf12-turtle/">RDF 1.2 Turtle</a> (e.g., reifying triple or 
          triple annotations). This will be done in strong cooperation with the 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/rdf-star">RDF &amp; SPARQL Working Group</a>.

	  <h2>Success Criteria</h2>

	  <p>In order to advance beyond
		  <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">Candidate Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent interoperable implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification, where interoperability can be verified by passing open test suites. In order to advance beyond Candidate Recommendation, each normative specification must have an open test suite of every feature defined in the specification.</p>

	  <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>

    <p>To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications
      in Candidate Recommendation
      or to features that have deployed implementations
      should have <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>.
    </p>

    <!-- Horizontal review -->

	  <p>Each specification should contain separate sections detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>

    <!-- W3C Statements and Web Platform Design Principles -->
    <p>This group is expected to be guided by the following documents:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ethical-web-principles/">Ethical Web Principles</a>,</li>

        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/other/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The
          Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
          The group also welcomes non-Members to make technical contributions for ongoing work, provided they agree to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/patent-policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Chairs should periodically look through the non-Members who have contributed to the Working Group or the JSON for Linking Data Community Group and consider whether each one should be invited to participate as an <a href="https://www.w3.org/invited-experts/">Invited Expert</a>. If a non-Member contributor would like to participate in meetings, they are encouraged to <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/json-ld/instructions/">apply to be an Invited Expert</a>.

          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.

          Decision Policy

        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period of <span id='cfc'>10 working days</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.

          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
